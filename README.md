Simulated annealing library (C++)

This was an attempt to distill what I knew about simulated annealing not
long after I sent several years working with it. It was written quite a
long time ago and not very thoroughly tested. My goals here were sort of
hobbled by the fact that many of the techniques I knew for making simulated
annealing awesome, I wasn't sure if they were trade secrets or IP owned by
my former employer or what, so I didn't include them in this code.
